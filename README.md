This is an individual mini-project.

A very initial form of an app where I use NY Times API, Google Street View API, and WikiMedia to render information based on the street name and city name. Planning to add more information by using more APIs (maybe Twitter for events, Craigslist for rentals, Foursquare for places to eat). Feel free to add patches!

Mostly, I have used AJAX with jQuery, and plan to use JavaScript further on...
Working app can be seen on http://samarthmshah.github.io/know_your_city/
